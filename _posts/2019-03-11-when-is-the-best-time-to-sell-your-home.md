I’m often asked about when the best time to put a home on the market is, so today I’ll take a few moments to explain my views.

**The ideal times to put your house on the market are the months between spring and late summer.** During this time, grass is greener, the weather is better, and the days are longer. This is also the time that you’ll see more buyers on the market, simply because it’s the time of year that families make decisions where they’re going to live for the upcoming school year.

The second most ideal time is during the fall. **In autumn, there will be fewer homes on the market for buyers to choose from, so it gives your house a bit of an advantage in the marketplace.**

Generally, you’ll probably want to avoid putting your house on the market in November and December, since **this is a time when people have turned their thoughts and focuses to the festivities of the holiday season.** People won’t necessarily want to deal with the stress of selling their home during a time when they’re frequently hosting family and friends for the holidays.

However, **though it isn’t an ideal time, it’s not impossible to sell during the winter.** To be honest, if you’ve employed an experienced real estate agent who understands the different market seasons, you should be able to sell your home almost anytime throughout the year. If you don’t have a choice to put your home on the market in the unpopular season, your agent will be able to strategize the best way to get your home in front of the most buyers possible.
