Today we’ll be going over what we saw throughout 2018’s real estate market, as well as what we forecast for 2019.

From 2017 to 2018, there was a slight decrease in home sales. **This is likely due to homeowners being more particular in their home purchases.** Interest rates also rose, and the home-affordability index reached a 10-year low.&nbsp;

The median sale price increased from $251,500 in 2017 to $266,500 in 2018. Average home prices also increased, but the number of days on market fell. Sellers were able to get 96.6% of their asking price. **Overall, we had a strong market in 2018.**

I recently attended an economic update event and learned a lot about what we have to look forward to in 2019. **The biggest news is that the Federal Reserve has decided to scale back its planned interest rate hikes.** As increased interest rates mean decreased buyer affordability, this is great news. We already saw rates decrease in December, and 2019 may bring further changes. Unemployment rates have also dropped, and consumer spending has gone up.
