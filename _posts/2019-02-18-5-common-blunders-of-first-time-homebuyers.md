First-time homebuyers sometimes make avoidable mistakes that prove to be costly to their interests. Here are five that are the most common:&nbsp;

**1. Failing to get pre-qualified.** Amid all the excitement about buying a new home, some first-time buyers get ahead of themselves and attempt to start the process with pre-qualification. Going through this process will give you a sense of what price range you’ll be situated in, what your future down payment will be, and what closing costs will look like. The last thing you want to do is try to go forward with a purchase and be denied in the qualification stage because you skipped pre-qualification.&nbsp;<br><br>**2. Assuming all loans are the same.** Not all home loans are created equal. Talk with multiple loan officers and compare the options you’re presented with. You may find the rates, fees, and down payment requirement are all different. Being diligent and shopping around could save you loads of money and will ensure that you receive financing that is tailored to your needs and budget.

**3. Failing to account for additional loan costs.** The down payment sometimes consumes most of the buyer’s attention when it comes to loan costs. However, ample consideration should be given to other costs such as the home inspection and closing costs; closing costs might include anything from a credit report fee to a home appraisal.&nbsp;<br><br>**4. Failing to get a home inspection.** With resale properties, the “wear and tear” element of past homeownership makes having a home inspection performed an easy decision to make. If you’re buying new construction, you’d also be well-advised to have an inspection done; the house may be new, but contractors have been hired to do construction on the home and mistakes are sometimes made. &nbsp;&nbsp;

**5. Failing to hire an agent who will work in their best interests.** Be sure that whoever you hire is working for you and you alone. An agent whose name appears on a “for sale” sign in a front yard is going to be acting in the interests of the seller. Here’s a little-known fact: You can actually be represented by a buyer’s agent without ever paying their fee—it can be paid at closing out of the seller’s side of the transaction. So doesn’t it make sense to obtain potentially cost-free representation knowing that that agent will work independently for you?&nbsp;<br><br>If you’re a first-time homebuyer and you’re ready to get into the market, click here to schedule a buyer readiness assessment with me.
