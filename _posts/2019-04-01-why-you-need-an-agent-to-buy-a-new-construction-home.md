I’m often asked, “Do I really need a real estate agent to help me buy a new construction home?” My answer is always yes, and here’s why.

When you encounter a real estate agent at a new home construction site, **you have to understand that this agent has been hired by the builder to represent their interests.** Don’t you think it would be wise to have a professional on your side as well? Think about it this way: You’d never go to court without an attorney. You want to be represented in this type of expensive purchase to ensure that your best interests are kept.

**Secondly, an agent can negotiate terms for you on things such as upgrades, closing costs, and incentives.** Your agent will work on your behalf to make sure you get the best price based on market value, as well as everything else the builder has to offer.

Signing the contract is just the beginning of the new home building process. You will have several meetings with the builders, tons of inspections, and you’ll have to work through the financing process. Having an experienced professional on your side will alleviate a lot of the stress you may go through during this process. **They are here to make your job a whole lot easier.**

As you can see, a real estate agent is essential for your representation when buying a new home. Did I mention the best part? The agent will work for you, and the builder will actually pay their fee. You get their representation for free, so it’s a no-brainer.
