In Deuteronomy 1:8, God tells us, “I've set this land before you. Go in and possess it\! This is a land that I told Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that I would give to them and their descendants thereafter.”

Who are those descendants? We are\! And because we are those descendants, God’s promise still resides with you today.&nbsp;

If you recall when the children of Israel took that trip from Egypt to the land that was promised to them, before they reached that finish line, they encountered giants. Those giants caused some of them to die in the wilderness; but it’s my job to help make sure that you do not die in the wilderness, and that you’re able to conquer every giant that stands in the way between you and your home.

**Here’s what GUEST \#1 had to say about my Possess the Land seminar:**

“We all know that we can buy a house possess land, but Shakeima goes into more of the barriers that we face. So many of us think that we don’t qualify for credit or that we don’t make enough money or that we don’t have what it takes to actually buy a house, but I believe that Scripture gives you a strong foundation to push through what she calls those ‘giants.’ I think that this is something that you would want to take advantage of. There’s so much valuable information packed into one great session.”

**GUEST \#2 had this to say about my workshop:**<br><br>“One of the things I loved most was feeling like I had someone I could trust to guide me through this workshop. There brokers there who we were able to ask our questions. We actually received all the tools that we need\! So if you’re looking to purchase a home or buy a home for you and your family, I would encourage you to seek a workshop by Shakeima. I can guarantee that you won’t be disappointed.”

**Finally, GUEST \#3&nbsp; said this**\:

“It was so much more than learning the ABCs of homebuying. It really chipped away at the mindset that will hold you from purchasing a home. She goes into so much detail scripturally and gives you your tools to get you over that hurdle. I encourage you to do what you need to do to clear your schedule and go to that seminar. You’ll get a booklet to do the homework that will give you the tools to move forward. You’ll also be able to purchase Shakeima’s book, “Possess the Land: The Believer’s Guide to Home Buying.” I got my autographed copy\!”
