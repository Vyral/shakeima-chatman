<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I’m sharing three tips you’ll want to consider if you’ve decided on buying a new home this year.</em></p>

If you’ve decided that 2020 will be the year you purchase a home, I have some quick tips to help you prepare for the home buying process:&nbsp;

**1\. Take a look at your savings.** While you may not need a 20% down payment, most loan programs will require at least 3% down. There are some programs that offer considerable down payment assistance beyond that, but, you’ll need to factor in closing costs, inspection costs, and your earnest deposit. Begin saving now; you may even want to set up a direct deposit home account so you’re not tempted to spend that money as soon as you earn it.&nbsp;

**2\. Consider your creditworthiness.** Make sure you understand what’s on your credit report. If there are any inaccuracies, now’s the time to resolve those. If you have credit cards, don’t max them out; keep your credit utilization under 30%. Avoid making any major purchases this year (e.g., new car or furniture), as this will impact your credit.&nbsp;

**3\. Contact a professional.** The road to homeownership does not have to be a lonely one. A professional can help you identify loan programs that you qualify for, as well as help you reign in or restore your credit. &nbsp;
