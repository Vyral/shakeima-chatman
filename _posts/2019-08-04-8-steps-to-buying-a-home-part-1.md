The first step each and every buyer takes in their home buying journey is **making the decision to buy.&nbsp;**

There are various reasons why people choose to buy a home, so today I’d like to point out some of the main motivating factors I hear.&nbsp;

For one thing, **there’s a lot of pride that comes with homeownership.** As a homeowner, you have the freedom to customize your home inside and out and to your liking, rather than needing approval from a landlord or apartment manager.

Plus, **there are financial incentives for purchasing a home** as well. At the beginning of your mortgage loan’s lifespan, the majority of your payments will go toward the interest on the loan. Come tax season, you can actually write off that interest.&nbsp;

Purchasing a home also **creates a sense of legacy for the homeowner and their family.** When I bought my home, I knew it was something that my children and their children thereafter would grow to be proud of. &nbsp;

To wrap up part one today, the first step to buying a home is really just making the decision to do so.&nbsp;
