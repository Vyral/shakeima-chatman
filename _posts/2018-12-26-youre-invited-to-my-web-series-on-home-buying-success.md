If you haven’t yet read my book, “Possess the Land: The Believer’s Guide to Home Buying,” it really takes a good look at the journey that the children of Israel took, from their escape from Egypt to their arrival in their promised land. It compares that journey to the one I’ve seen homebuyers take.

I’ve worked with hundreds of homebuyers over the years, and there are three things that I noticed they tend to encounter on their journey to buying a home. They get excited just as the children of Israel did when they took off on their way to the promised land, but along the way, they encountered giants. **The three giants that homebuyers usually have a hard time with are these:**

1. Managing their money
2. Demolishing their debt
3. Conquering their credit
