What’s the key to presenting a strong offer in a seller’s market?

First, let’s clarify what it means to be in a “seller’s market.” To determine whether we’re in a buyer’s or seller’s market, we look at one factor: the months of inventory. A balanced market, for example, has six months of inventory—meaning it would take six months to sell off all the homes on the market. Anything under that six-month market is considered a seller’s market, while anything over is considered a buyer’s market.&nbsp;

Since our area has roughly 3.5 months of inventory, we’re in a clear seller’s market. Since sellers have more choices in terms of which offer they want to accept, there are some key tips you need to remember if you want to make yourself stand out as a buyer.

First, **make sure you’re not just pre-qualified, but also pre-approved.** Getting pre-qualified entails just giving information to a loan officer. The pre-approval process, on the other hand, involves sending documents to an actual underwriter. This is very helpful because it shows the seller you’re financially prepared to purchase their home and you can close faster than the competition.&nbsp;

Next, **eliminate as many contingencies as you can.** In this type of market, the fewer contingencies your offer has, the more attractive it looks to sellers. You won’t want to waive your home inspection, for example, but you should consider waiving the amount of time you need to complete that inspection. Also, if there are cosmetic issues around the home that need to be addressed, try doing them on your own later on instead of adding them as a contingency. &nbsp;

After that, **be prepared to pay for your own closing costs.** When a seller is looking at multiple offers, whether or not they’ll have to cover the closing costs is a factor they may consider. Remember, they’re trying to make a financial gain in this situation, so if you need to have your closing costs paid but another buyer doesn’t, that will make your competitor’s offer much more attractive.&nbsp;

Lastly, **be prepared to close as soon as possible.** The seller of the home you want may need to sell for financial reasons, or they may be itching to move on to the next adventure in their life. In any case, if you’re in a position to close sooner, that will make your offer more attractive.&nbsp;

How do you know how fast you can close? Talk to your loan officer—they’ll be able to tell you the specific closing timelines of various loans. Conventional loans, for instance, usually close quicker than VA and/or FHA loans.
