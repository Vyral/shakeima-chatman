Today I want to extend a special invitation to you. Do you have the desire to buy a home but haven’t quite taken the leap yet? Are you looking for answers on how to get started? Have you gotten started, but encountered stumbling blocks? **If you can answer yes to any of these questions, you’re exactly who I want to see on July 13 at the Holiday Inn Express (7670 Northwoods Blvd.) here in Charleston.**

I’m hosting a special “Possess the Land” homebuyers workshop based on my book “Possess the Land: The Believer’s Guide to Home Buying” and I want you to join me. **Not only will we tell you how to buy a home, but we will give you the spiritual and practical tools necessary to get you there.**

There will be loan officers on-site to run your credit and give you the tips and information you need to get qualified. I’m also going to give you a special workbook for you to take home that will serve as an action plan to get you into your new home.

My book is based on Deuteronomy 1 and 8 where God made a special promise to the children of Israel when he told them to “go in and possess” the land he had given to them after promising Isaac, Abraham, and Jacob. **We are their ancestors, too, and because he gave that promise to them, that promise still works for us today.&nbsp;**

If you’re ready to take action and “go in and possess” your home, register for my July 13 workshop <u><a target="_blank" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/possess-the-land-home-buyer-workshop-tickets-62901200183"><strong>here</strong></a></u>.

If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
