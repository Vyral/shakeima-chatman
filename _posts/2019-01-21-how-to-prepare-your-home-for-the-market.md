Preparing your home for the market can seem like a daunting task, but following just five simple tips can make doing so easier and also help you achieve a more successful sale:

**1. Order a pre-listing inspection.** For an investment between $250 and $400, this inspection will give you the opportunity to identify and resolve potential problems before a buyer sees your home. Leaving these issues for the buyer to find, instead, could scare them away from the deal. Think of it this way: If there are two cans of peas on a grocery store shelf, the one that’s dented will automatically be sold at a discount—even if the food inside it is perfectly fine.<br><br>**2. Declutter.** Buyers want to visualize your house as their future home, and the more clutter you have sitting around, the more difficult it will be for them to do this. Sorting through, throwing away, and packing up items will not only make your listing appear more attractive to buyers, but it will also give you a headstart on moving.

**3. Make sure your house is sparkling clean.** When was the last time you gave every nook and cranny of your home a good, deep cleaning? General upkeep is important, but the cleaning tasks you do each week won’t be enough when it comes time to put it on the market. Going the extra mile to give your home a spotless shine will make a massive difference in your success.&nbsp;<br><br>**4. Increase your home’s curb appeal.** The exterior of your home will be the first thing buyers see in online photos and when they arrive for their first showing. Therefore, making a good first impression will be critical. Spruce up your landscaping, repaint your front door, and add pops of color by setting out pots of seasonal flowers. All of these small touches will go a long way.<br><br>**5. Find a good agent.** The process of selling a home can be quite complex. An experienced Realtor will be able to guide you through each step, from pricing your home competitively to dealing with negotiations later on. Why do all these things by yourself when you could have a tried-and-true professional by your side?
