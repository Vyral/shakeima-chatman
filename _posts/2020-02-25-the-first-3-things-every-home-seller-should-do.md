*There are three things you can do right now to help prepare your home for sale. Here’s the list.*

Are you thinking of selling your home in 2020, but don’t know where to start? Here are a few things that you can be doing now to prepare your home:

**1\. Take some time to declutter.** Streamline your home to make it look like a model on a new construction site. This means moving your items and organizing closets. Donate unused items so they are out of the way and you can create an environment in which homebuyers can see themselves living.

**2\. Consider repairs.** It’s often best to identify repairs ahead of time before a homebuyer or inspector does. You can do this by hiring your own inspector to give you a list of recommended repairs, or call a contractor to help out if you already have a list. If that list is taken care of beforehand, you won't have to worry about hidden expenses down the road.

**3\. Know your numbers.** Understand what your mortgage payoff will be and what you can list your home for to get a better idea of what your net will be after the sale. You can do this by contacting a professional for a complimentary market analysis.
